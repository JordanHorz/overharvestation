<h1 style="position:relative;bottom:-20px;font-size: 3em;">Overharvestation of dodo birds</h1>
<h3 style="position:relative;bottom:-80px"> The dodo bird went extinct in around 1681, because Dutch sailors found them easy to catch. Their lack of fear of humans meant that they did not flee at the sight of humans, and their slow speed did not help with their survival. Also, they were flightless birds, so that they could not take to the skies to help them escape. Dodo eggs were also particularly appetizing for pigs, dogs, and rats, so their consumption disrupted the food chain. This also ties in to the concept of invasive species, because the introduction of sailors, their dogs and other animals were the introduction of additional species into the food chain of the dodo birdâ€™s particular habitat.
The reason that they did not fear humans was because they were the apex predator of their habitat.</h3>
<h2 style="position:relative;bottom:-100px">Being the apex predator of their habitat, they had the most trophic levels about them, and that means that the highest amount of energy is lost in their prey going to them. The dodo was found on Mauritius island. When sailors arrived, they also brought the loss of their habitat to the island, which contributed to the extinction of the dodo birds as well.</h2>
